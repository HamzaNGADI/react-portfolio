# React Portfolio

The current portfolio site is intended for the global presentation of my profile, as well as an overview of my acquired skills, the scientific articles published during my thesis, and the projects I developed during my university studies or as a self-taught artist. The full or partial source code of these projects is available on GitHub.

The website is developed with the React.js framework, using TypeScript and JavaScript, built and deployed with Vite, including Tailwind CSS for styling and design, Devicon for icon display, and Motion for animations.
